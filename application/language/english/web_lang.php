Once the connection is terminated both the phone and the device will give signal lost alert. Bluetooth has a high frequency band, which its effectiveness for communication maybe limited by the environment. Multiple walls, sold objects, and other interference may decrease the effectiveness of the Bluetooth signal. We have maximized the MYNT range for personal item tracking within normal distance.</p><h2>Remote Control</h2><p>MYNT tracker is equipped with a remote circuit and a control button. When connected with any device, the MYNT signal will be interpreted by the App and assigned functions according to user settings. The standard HID is used, thus a range of Apps are compatible with MYNT remote control. It is similar to a condensed keyboard that is compatible with most devises on the market. The predominant user setting is remote controlling camera shutter, volume control, and music shuffle. User may assign new functions through the app.</p>';
